## If you're still reading...

An “About me” page makes me feel a bit awkward. But in a world full of polished, AI-sounding text, I figured leaving something slightly uncomfortable — and unmistakably human — might be worth it. (That said, I do rely quite a bit on AI for the more formal parts.)

I’m more interested in building meaningful products than obsessing over a single technology.
What I focus on tends to change depending on the product—its users, its constraints, and the kind of impact it aims to make. I enjoy figuring out what actually matters in each context and choosing the right tools accordingly.

I was born and raised in South Korea, but I’ve always been curious about the world beyond it. Since my early twenties, I’ve spent time traveling and hosting travelers, which taught me how much you can learn from people with different backgrounds. Going forward, I hope to spend longer periods living in other countries—not just visiting, but understanding societies in ways short trips rarely allow.
