### Geultto: Nature of the Community

Upon initial encounter with the term "Geultto," it appeared remarkably endearing. I presumed 'tto' constituted an abbreviation of terminology such as 'peer group,' discovering subsequently it signified 'crazy person' (tto-ra-i).

Quoting founder Byun Sung-yun's introduction:

**Geultto = 'Writing crazy people who change the world'**

**"A community strengthening developers' writing capabilities and facilitating consistent writing."**

The orientation transpired approximately two weekends prior, with active discussions already occurring across multiple Slack channels. The membership comprises 136 individuals. Perhaps due to COVID-19's social restrictions, the orientation day engendered excitement, with Sung-yun's philosophy proving admirable. I have been enjoying the freely created channel discussions and articles.

### Motivations for Geultto 6th Cohort Application

During this blog's establishment, I applied a Gatsby theme, consulting a particular blog during application and customization.

[https://juneyr.dev/](https://juneyr.dev/) << This blog, whose author writes excellently and shares numerous commonalities with me, prompted extensive reading. The Geultto 4th cohort retrospective proved particularly compelling.

Subsequently discovering the Geultto 5th cohort recruitment announcement, I hesitated to apply immediately. Circumstances remained uncertain, precluding confident resource allocation and commitment assessment. Despite non-application, I resolved to maintain blogging efforts, committing to consistent posting when feasible.

However, blog composition demands several-fold greater effort than Notion drafting, with neither topic identification nor compositional motivation proving readily achievable independently. Moreover, unconsciously established standards existed. Principles such as 'avoid topics and depth levels commonly addressed across numerous blogs wherever possible'... As a junior developer, realistic adherence to such principles severely restricts available topics. Perfectionist tendencies regarding articles resulted in inaction.

Upon recognizing this issue, I determined to abandon perfectionist article conceptualization, supplement insufficient motivation through communal participation, and actively sought the Geultto 6th cohort recruitment announcement, applying immediately upon discovery.

+) I contemplated establishing a writing group within my existing developer community. However, curiosity regarding Geultto's six-cohort continuity, operational methodologies, and desire for novel acquaintances prevailed.

### Desired Article Types

(Current conceptualizations may diverge substantially from actual authorship ^^)

1. Elasticsearch accumulated topic collection
    - Korean language searches frequently yielded inadequate results during previous projects, inspiring aspirations for comprehensive blog documentation. Potential tutorial-format composition under consideration.
2. MySQL performance tuning insights
3. Comprehensive HTTP caching and web technology exposition
4. Conceptual organization regarding critical yet somewhat nebulous backend developer concepts
    - Likely the most frequent category
5. Detailed debugging problem-resolution process documentation
    - Previously confined such documentation to personal Notion notes with minimal comprehensibility; proper composition might benefit others...
6. Side project insights or retrospectives
7. Quality foreign blog article translations
    - Translation authorship aspiration. Concurrent English study resumption necessity. When encountering English articles meriting dissemination. Impressive if presenting: 'I translated this, please read!'

### Maintained Attitudes During Activities

1. Active communication
2. Detailed feedback provision. When capacity permits, provide feedback beyond designated periods for feedback requesters
3. Meet all article submission deadlines and recover entire deposit

### Expectations Upon 6th Cohort Conclusion

Confidence in producing quality articles with modest time investment,

Anticipation of substantially enriched article collection compared to present status.
