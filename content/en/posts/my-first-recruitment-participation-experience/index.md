I had conceptualized recruitment participation as an experience reserved for 10+ year senior engineers, forgetting my startup employment status (now past tense). When our team required backend developers, I received the extraordinary opportunity to participate subsidiary in recruitment for 1-2 positions. Company scale enabled this experience, with uncertain future opportunities. The recruiter perspective revealed numerous misunderstandings from previous job-seeking activities. Hence, I document recruiter-perspective observations regarding resumes, assignments, and interviews.

(Documenting subjective reflections for potential future job-seeking or interviewer scenarios, though uncertain whether a 5-year practitioner should publicly author such content...)

## Resumes

### Regrettable Resumes

- Significant valuable experiences relegated to pages 1-2 and beyond
    - Extremely busy recruitment personnel might not read that far... (Though I read everything. Fear of missing exceptional candidates?) Resume consultants' advice proved accurate: resume initial sections determine continued focused reading versus skimming. Conversely, undesirable educational backgrounds and development-irrelevant experiences positioned prominently proved frustrating.
- Vaguely described experiences
    - 'XX team coupon domain maintenance' and similar abstract descriptions proved most disappointing. Maintenance nature and implementation details remained obscure. Even domain-similar work provided insufficient confidence regarding candidate capability.
    - Previously, I excessively abbreviated resume content (believing 1-2 page constraints applied), or assumed interview detailed inquiry... but summarization quality varies significantly.
    - Providing maximum confidence to document reviewers necessitates maximally achievement-oriented lucid experience expression. However, excessive text burdens readers; desired emphasis necessitates appropriate abstraction.
- Distracting resumes
    - Examples: Format severely corrupted upon submission, undesirable photographs (eating, et cetera, clearly inappropriate for profiles), development-irrelevant career excessively lengthy descriptions
    - I once considered resume photographs necessary, attending to photography, but viewing attached photographs generally prompted merely 'photograph attached' observations.

### Admirable Resumes

- Per-project documentation of proactive improvement experiences or novel technology adoption achievements
- Operating/operational side projects with verifiable links
- Resumes providing confidence regarding non-generic recruitment platform distribution - resumes containing even brief company-specific application rationale

### Evolved Perspectives

- Formerly, I interpreted resume rejections as 100% attributable to inadequate resume composition + personal inadequacy. This may partially hold true. However, 100% attribution proves inaccurate. Applicants remain ignorant of company circumstances. Our company's limited resources precluded risk-taking recruitment and onboarding for candidates lacking practical experience. (Had we possessed greater scale and positions, numerous candidates would have advanced to assignments.) Despite exceptional resumes, tearful rejection votes were cast. Similarly, experience misalignment resulted in resume rejection difficulty.
    - ⇒ Conclusion: Avoid excessive concern regarding resume rejections. No need for tearful distress...

## Assignments

- 'How this person typically works' manifests substantially through assignments
- Excessive technology application beyond requirements merely elevating complexity without clear selection rationale appeared unfavorable. Potentially mere technology experimentation...
- README documentation of ERDs, technology stacks, et cetera proves beneficial, but **summarizing contemplated concerns and emphasized points during assignment completion** would prove advantageous for differentiation. Such candidates were rarely encountered.

## Interviews

- Exceptional self-introductions prove unnecessary, but minimum nervousness-free articulation proves preferable
    - I experienced such failures through excessive self-introduction preparation and interviewer intimidation. Such nervousness initiates cascading failures. Interviewers attempt maximum tension relief and genuine capability assessment, but cannot exceed certain assistance thresholds.
- 'Will they perform well in our team' supersedes 'Are they exceptional developers' in evaluation
    - Job-seeking excessively focused on 'exceptional person' presentation. However, recruitment continuously considers 'Will this person perform adequately in our team, how will they communicate during problem scenarios, will they positively influence the development team,' with insufficient judgment prompting additional inquiry.
- Fundamental inquiry responses reveal candidate depth. Hence, experienced candidates may receive fundamental questions... Explanatory capability proves essential
- Concrete problem-resolution experience narration
    - Context formation with interviewers regarding problems and solutions necessitates diverse information provision. Situational circumstances, task necessity, technology selection rationale, results, poor result learning. Additional inquiry occurs during comprehension gaps. Initial interviewer comprehension success enables subsequent discussion.

## Future Recruitment Responsibility

- Lesson 1: Recruitment simultaneously constitutes company and team branding opportunities
- Lesson 2: Clearly define recruitment expectations
- Conduct greater interview and quality question research before interviews
    - Imbue each question with intentionality, consider candidate reception
    - Prepare follow-up questions for capacity ambiguity despite prepared questions, considering various situational flows
